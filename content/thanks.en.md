Wow, thank you so much for your donation! Your really help us to continue running our website free for everyone in the future and also to start new project for data protection in Europe. You can read about what exactly will happen with your donation in our [yearly reports]({{< ref "transparency" >}}).

If you would like to regularly support us or you just want to be more involved, you can also [become a member]({{< ref "become-a-member" >}}).

If your donated less than 200 €, the German tax offices will also accept a [simplified donation receipt](https://dacdn.de/vereinfachter-zuwendungsnachweis.pdf) in combination with your payment receipt (bank statement, credit card invoice, …) for your tax deduction. For larger donation you will need a donation receipt in the official form. You can get one of these from us of course, but we do need your address for that. Please send us an email at [vorstand@datenanfragen.de](mailto:vorstand@datenanfragen.de) (you can encrypt it with [this key](/pgp/62A7EC35.asc)) with your address and donation ID resp. the reference of your bank transfer.
