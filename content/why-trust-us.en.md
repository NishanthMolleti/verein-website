In order to create your requests, you need to enter a lot of sensible data. For example what companies you are going to request, your identification data, your signature and the content of your request. On this page we want to explain to you, why you can trust us, so that you don't have to worry while you are using the generator.  

# Privacy by default

"Privacy by default" means that all settings that are relevant for your data protection are set per default in a way that you only need to change them when you want to activate additional features. So you don't have to be worried that your data is in danger the first time you visit our website.

# Minimal data

All our systems are set up in a way that they collect as few as possible data of you, best none. Often, it is not possible to completely abolish all data, for example when you type something in the search: It happens on our servers sot that you'll have to send your search query to us first. In these cases we never save your data (only if we are required to by law).

However, most of the data that you enter in the generator is never even sent. So that you don't even have to trust us, we programmed it in such a way that all requests are generated on your computer. That means that we never receive more data than that your IP is using our generator.

# Open source

It is nice, of course, that we tell tell you all about how few data the generator sends to us, but meaningless if it would be totally different in reality. Whether we lie to you is something that you can check yourself: All of our code (even the infrastructure setup for the search server and so on) if open and public on [GitHub](https://github.com/datenanfragen). If you know how, you can even build your own generator and use it completely separat from us.

# Constitution

[Our constitution]({{< ref "constitution" >}}) describes exactly, what purpose our association has and the general assembly checks whether we stick to the plan. That way we can ensure that datarequests.org is independent from the people who are working on it. Our constitution are requires us to act as a non-profit.

# Being a non-profit

With us being a non-profit and charitable organisation we promise that the use of all our projects will be free as long as it exists. We do not have any interest in earning money so we have no reason to sell your data or make money out of your rights. That we stick to that is not only ensured by the general assembly but also by the German tax authorities.

# Transparency

The association and the operation of the website have been created in a way to make it easy to have insight in the processes. We are part of the Initiative for a Transparent Civil Society and regularly publish information on our current management on our [transparency page]({{< ref "transparency" >}}). Of course all the important things can also be found on the website or [GitHub](https://github.com/datenanfragen). If you still need information or you have any questions, you can contact our board: [vorstand@datenanfragen.de](mailto:vorstand@datenanfragen.de)
