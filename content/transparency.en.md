In order for you to be able to trust us, we pledged to be as transparent as possible about our procedures, finances and decisions. Because of that, we are planing to join the [Initiative for a Transparent Civil Society](https://www.transparency.de/mitmachen/initiative-transparente-zivilgesellschaft/), an initiative by the German branch of Transparency International, which is allowed to audit us on a sample basis. They ensure that we will keep our promise of transparent management. On this page we summarized all the important information that we publish as part of that.
